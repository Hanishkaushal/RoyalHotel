                <p><b>William Shakespeare lived through one of the most turbulent yet thrilling era's of English history</b>
                    Facts can be deceiving. We know, for example, that William’s father, John Shakespeare, was a glove-maker, 
                    cotton dealer and businessman; his mother, Mary, was from a farming family. In attempting to discover the 
                    life of William, we often make the mistake of attaining only shreds of information from his parents life. 
                    It is a mistake because, especially with John Shakespeare, it tells us more about the world Shakespeare was 
                    brought up in than is often thought. If we dig, we learn that John became town councillor and mayor. But we 
                    also learn how he made his fortune: by dealing illegally in wool, and then losing it, to the point of even 
                    fearing to leave his home for fear of arrest. We know this because he was ordered to pay a fine for his illicit 
                    activities. Later on, his fortune began to collapse, he sold properties, pulled William out of school, which is 
                    significant. He took William out of school denying him the chance to further his studies; to go to university, 
                    William also lost his grandfather’s inheritance. William Shakespeare was lucky: a year before his birth, in 
                    1563, the Plague returned, killing seven per cent of Stratford’s population, but when Shakespeare was born, 
                    it was almost over. Unlike Shakespeare’s two younger siblings, William survived infancy. Another piece of luck 
                    for young William was John’s position as town councillor, when William was only four. Because of his father's 
                    role, William was able to attend school, read the classics such as Ovid's Metamorphosis, which became his 
                    favourite book. The hours were long for the boy. In the summer, he would have to be up as early as three o’clock in the morning. 
                    In school he and other children would translate Latin texts into English and vice versa. 
                    At age 14, as his parents position took a turn for the worst, he was pulled out of school, denying him the chance of his passion 
                    as a youngster: the pursuit of literature and poetry. He met Anne Hathaway, his future wife, married her at 18; she was at least 
                    eight years his senior. We then have the famous seven years, from 1585-92, what we refer to as the lost years. 
                    Shakespeare disappears for seven years, arrives in London writing play after play, writing comedy, history and tragedy; 
                    the theatre houses would often be full performing the plays of Shakespeare. As always, however, in our lives, there is conflict 
                    and tragedy, and the worst thing that could happen to any father, happened to Shakespeare. Hamnet, his son, died, on August 11, 1596, aged just 11.
