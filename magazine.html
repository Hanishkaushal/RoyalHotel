                        <p>In 1992, Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales and heir to the British Throne visited India along with his wife, Diana, the Princess of Wales.
                            Though this was not widely-known at the time, the Wales’ marriage was in deep trouble. According to her own account (given later to many journalists including Andrew Morton), Diana felt neglected, betrayed and alone.
                            She retaliated by staging little PR stunts which showed her in a good light while enraging her husband. When Prince Charles made in clear that he did not have the time to visit Agra, the Princess said she would go on her own.
                            When she got to the Taj Mahal, which security had cleared of all visitors and tourists, the Princess sat alone on a bench, framed by the Taj which loomed majestically behind her.
                            That photograph was transmitted around the world within hours and made the front pages of many newspapers. It sent out the message that Diana had hoped to convey: she was a lonely, unloved, neglected wife, forced to visit the world’s greatest symbol of love all alone because her husband could not be bothered to share the experience with her.
                            even today when foreign tourists arrive at the Taj, they ask to be taken to the ‘Diana bench’. Tens of thousands have since had their own photographs taken there, posing like the Princess with the Taj behind them. For them, the location echoes the most famous love-gone-wrong story of recent decades.
                            Which is ironic because the Taj is really the perfect symbol of love-that-never-went-wrong; of a love so overwhelming that it led another royal personage, centuries before the Wales’ had their domestic drama, to build one of the most beautiful mausoleums known to mankind.
                            I thought about these ironies when I went back to Agra a few weeks ago. Till the beginning of this century, the only way to see the Taj was to buy a ticket and brave the tourist hordes who had come to see one of the wonders of the medieval world.
                            But this time I was at The Oberoi Amarvilās, Agra, a hotel dedicated to the beauty of the Taj. It is one of the few hotels in the world (and the only one I have ever stayed in) where all the rooms face in the same direction: towards the Taj.
                            you get a view of the monument from every single room and because The Oberoi Amarvilās, Agra is so close to the Taj with only a patch of green separating them, you almost feel that you are sharing a garden with the Taj.
                            As a consequence I spent nearly all of my time at The Oberoi Amarvilās, Agra, transfixed by the view, staring at the Taj all the time. I ate most of my meals on the open balcony which let me look at Taj. When I woke up each morning I 
                            would rush to draw open the curtains so that the sunlight brought a Taj view into the room. And baths took forever because the bathtub had a terrific view of the Taj and I soaked happily in the water while taking in the view that I knew would stay with me all my life.
                            The thing is: I am no stranger to the Taj. I have seen it up close several times. I have toured the insides of the structure. And I have been fortunate enough to see it lit up in the moonlight for a concert by the musician Yanni.
                            But these have been tourist visits. You come to Agra. You check in to your hotel. You take a car and go to the Taj. You tour the complex. You come back to your hotel. And that’s it.
                            The wonderful thing about The Oberoi Amarvilās, Agra is that your experience of the Taj is not restricted to a single visit. The Taj is always there, every time you look out of your window. It doesn’t become a tourist site. It becomes a beautiful neighbour who is always ready to be admired.

                        <p><b>William Shakespeare lived through one of the most turbulent yet thrilling era's of English history</b>
                        Facts can be deceiving. We know, for example, that William’s father, John Shakespeare, was a glove-maker, 
                        cotton dealer and businessman; his mother, Mary, was from a farming family. In attempting to discover the 
                        life of William, we often make the mistake of attaining only shreds of information from his parents life. 
                        It is a mistake because, especially with John Shakespeare, it tells us more about the world Shakespeare was 
                        brought up in than is often thought. If we dig, we learn that John became town councillor and mayor. But we 
                        also learn how he made his fortune: by dealing illegally in wool, and then losing it, to the point of even 
                        fearing to leave his home for fear of arrest. We know this because he was ordered to pay a fine for his illicit 
                        activities. Later on, his fortune began to collapse, he sold properties, pulled William out of school, which is 
                        significant. He took William out of school denying him the chance to further his studies; to go to university, 
                        William also lost his grandfather’s inheritance. William Shakespeare was lucky: a year before his birth, in 
                        1563, the Plague returned, killing seven per cent of Stratford’s population, but when Shakespeare was born, 
                        it was almost over. Unlike Shakespeare’s two younger siblings, William survived infancy. Another piece of luck 
                        for young William was John’s position as town councillor, when William was only four. Because of his father's 
                        role, William was able to attend school, read the classics such as Ovid's Metamorphosis, which became his 
                        favourite book. The hours were long for the boy. In the summer, he would have to be up as early as three o’clock in the morning. 
                        In school he and other children would translate Latin texts into English and vice versa. 
                        At age 14, as his parents position took a turn for the worst, he was pulled out of school, denying him the chance of his passion 
                        as a youngster: the pursuit of literature and poetry. He met Anne Hathaway, his future wife, married her at 18; she was at least 
                        eight years his senior. We then have the famous seven years, from 1585-92, what we refer to as the lost years. 
                        Shakespeare disappears for seven years, arrives in London writing play after play, writing comedy, history and tragedy; 
                        the theatre houses would often be full performing the plays of Shakespeare. As always, however, in our lives, there is conflict 
                        and tragedy, and the worst thing that could happen to any father, happened to Shakespeare. Hamnet, his son, died, on August 11, 1596, aged just 11.

                        <p><b>While central Melbourne has its own allure, the city’s charm lies in its diverse suburbs, each of which tells a different tale words Lucinda</b>
                            Hawksley Melbourne has a long history of loving art. The first art gallery in Australia was opened here, in 1861, and the city has 
                            always had a reputation for being “arty”. Today, alongside all the official galleries, tourists and locals are eager to witness an 
                            ever-evolving art – the art of the streets. It keeps changing, sometimes, daily. The most famous street to visit is the Hosier Lane 
                            (not far from Flinders Street station), where you’ll witness street artists at work, blithely ignoring all the tourists and clatter,
                             comings and goings all around them, and working just as anyone else would do at their day job. This is because, in Melbourne, street 
                             art is now definitely art, not just graffiti, and in these streets, it’s not only permitted, but actively encouraged. Gone are the 
                             days when street artists had to work furtively, under cover of darkness, risking arrest for their art. Now it’s mainstream, and even 
                             the local Melbourne authorities agree that it’s good for artistic expression – and the tourist dollar! There are art-covered streets 
                             (with varying degrees of skill) all over the city. In the CBD (Central Business District) these include Strachan Lane, Rutledge Lane, 
                             Beaney Lane, Snider Lane, Rankins Lane, Caledonian Lane, Presgrave Place, Union Lane, Drewery Lane and Duckboard Place. But for fans 
                             of rock and heavy metal, there is only one place to get to: AC/DC Lane. Yes, it is actually named after the Australian rock band. 
                             Until 2004, it was the much-more conservative Corporation Lane, but that didn’t attract as many pilgrims seeking their heroes as 
                             AC/DC Lane does. Here, the art isn’t only painted on the walls, it’s coming out to get you. Former AC/DC singer Bon Scott (who died 
                             in 1980), has been sculpted bursting through the brickwork, created by sculptor Mike Makatron.
                            <br>
                            You can download an official street art map and visit the streets on your own, but there are great street art tours, led by working 
                            artists, which not only give you far more information that you’d find on your own, but also give you the chance to visit their studios 
                            at the end of the tours. Yes, it’s a blatant way for them to sell their work, but surely it’s better to go home with a genuine work 
                            of Australian art, rather than mass-produced tourist tat. Street art in Melbourne ranges from simple but pithy stencilled slogans 
                            such as “Binge thinking is bad for your health”, to witty works by Stampz, including his kissing Disney princesses, and movingly 
                            beautiful images by @n20_jo. Her works are so gorgeous that they make you stop, look and then keep looking. As with all the best 
                            street art, there are brilliant political works, such as pasted-up posters by Peter Drew, whose “Aboriginal Land Real Australians 
                            Seek Welcome” highlights injustices against the Aboriginal community, who are, despite many attempts to pretend otherwise, the 
                            original and only indigenous Australians. Another strikingly beautiful work, painted high over Hosier Lane is a massive, haunting 
                            portrait of an Aboriginal child, gazing across the top of Melbourne. He looks over what is now the city’s northern suburbs towards 
                            what was once a revered and sacred Aboriginal site. The portrait, by artist Adnate, stays in your vision long after seeing it. Long 
                            may it stay up there – as far as Adnate is concerned, it will be there until the elements destroy it, which seems a fitting analogy. 
                            There’s controversy here too: the working street artists, who lead the tours, despise over-commercialisation of the area. It might 
                            seem like a sweet irony, as they guide paying tourists through the maze of painted streets, but I understood what they meant, as we 
                            passed shops charging prices for so-called “street clothing” which only and only those in the salary bracket of a corporate lawyer 
                            (or drug dealer) could afford to buy with ease. These shops often pay street artists to create works – but isn’t that selling out? 
                            That was the question on seemingly all the artists lips. Though, having said that, UK street artist Banksy has still spoken about 
                            on the Melbourne scene with awe – yes, his works may be worth a fortune, but the reclusive Banksy still uses his talent to highlight social 
                            injustices and, often, to make others’ fortunes. When he paints on the sides of poor-looking buildings in the dead of night, he 
                            bequeaths a generous gift to the building’s owners, rather than making money from it himself. The greater irony I found on our 
                            tour was passionate way in which our 
                            street artist tour guide ranted against single-use plastics – whilst carrying a single-use-plastic water bottle.</p>
