                <p>In 1992, Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales and heir to the British Throne visited India along with his wife, Diana, the Princess of Wales.
                    Though this was not widely-known at the time, the Wales’ marriage was in deep trouble. According to her own account (given later to many journalists including Andrew Morton), Diana felt neglected, betrayed and alone.
                    She retaliated by staging little PR stunts which showed her in a good light while enraging her husband. When Prince Charles made in clear that he did not have the time to visit Agra, the Princess said she would go on her own.
                    When she got to the Taj Mahal, which security had cleared of all visitors and tourists, the Princess sat alone on a bench, framed by the Taj which loomed majestically behind her.
                    That photograph was transmitted around the world within hours and made the front pages of many newspapers. It sent out the message that Diana had hoped to convey: she was a lonely, unloved, neglected wife, forced to visit the world’s greatest symbol of love all alone because her husband could not be bothered to share the experience with her.
                    even today when foreign tourists arrive at the Taj, they ask to be taken to the ‘Diana bench’. Tens of thousands have since had their own photographs taken there, posing like the Princess with the Taj behind them. For them, the location echoes the most famous love-gone-wrong story of recent decades.
                    Which is ironic because the Taj is really the perfect symbol of love-that-never-went-wrong; of a love so overwhelming that it led another royal personage, centuries before the Wales’ had their domestic drama, to build one of the most beautiful mausoleums known to mankind.
                    I thought about these ironies when I went back to Agra a few weeks ago. Till the beginning of this century, the only way to see the Taj was to buy a ticket and brave the tourist hordes who had come to see one of the wonders of the medieval world.
                    But this time I was at The Oberoi Amarvilās, Agra, a hotel dedicated to the beauty of the Taj. It is one of the few hotels in the world (and the only one I have ever stayed in) where all the rooms face in the same direction: towards the Taj.
                    you get a view of the monument from every single room and because The Oberoi Amarvilās, Agra is so close to the Taj with only a patch of green separating them, you almost feel that you are sharing a garden with the Taj.
                    As a consequence I spent nearly all of my time at The Oberoi Amarvilās, Agra, transfixed by the view, staring at the Taj all the time. I ate most of my meals on the open balcony which let me look at Taj. When I woke up each morning I 
                    would rush to draw open the curtains so that the sunlight brought a Taj view into the room. And baths took forever because the bathtub had a terrific view of the Taj and I soaked happily in the water while taking in the view that I knew would stay with me all my life.
                    The thing is: I am no stranger to the Taj. I have seen it up close several times. I have toured the insides of the structure. And I have been fortunate enough to see it lit up in the moonlight for a concert by the musician Yanni.
                    But these have been tourist visits. You come to Agra. You check in to your hotel. You take a car and go to the Taj. You tour the complex. You come back to your hotel. And that’s it.
                    The wonderful thing about The Oberoi Amarvilās, Agra is that your experience of the Taj is not restricted to a single visit. The Taj is always there, every time you look out of your window. It doesn’t become a tourist site. It becomes a beautiful neighbour who is always ready to be admired.
