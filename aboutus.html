                    <p>
                        Our story wrote its early chapters in 1934 in Shimla where Mr. M.S. Oberoi pioneered the idea of luxury hospitality in 
                        India by opening his first hotel. The lessons self-taught, the inevitable mistakes made, the wisdom gained, 
                        the prestigious awards won. All have formed the compass for successive generations of Oberois.
                        <br><br>
                        To this day, we still practice the most simple and uncommon of operational philosophies that began with 
                        Mr. M.S. Oberoi himself and now echoed by his son and current chairman Mr. P.R. S. Oberoi: The guest is 
                        everything.
                        <br><br>
                        Our joy comes from ensuring each is seen and valued as a person, a friend, a family member who has come to 
                        stay. It's present in every gesture through words spoken or unspoken, in ways that are obvious and in ways 
                        that are quietly respectful of one's time and privacy.
                        <br><br>
                        You will be hard pressed to find properties as beautiful as ours or restaurants, guest rooms and facilities 
                        that are as exceptional. But these are not what give Oberoi Hotels & Resorts its incomparable reputation.
                        <br><br>
                        What our guests speak about most is that singular experience of being truly seen, heard and understood. 
                        Something no other hotel or resort can emulate. The astonishing effect one feels from an act, a gesture, a 
                        word; that is heart felt.

                        <br>
                        Founder Chairman, The Royal Group
                        <br><b>Early Life</b>
                        <br>
                        Rai Bahadur Mohan Singh Oberoi was born on 15th August, 1898 in erstwhile undivided Punjab, which is now in 
                        Pakistan. He was only six months old when his father died. Success and fortune did not, therefore, come easily 
                        to him. Initiative, resourcefulness and hard work, combined with the capability to face and overcome the most 
                        overwhelming odds can best characterise this phenomenal entrepreneur.
                        <br><br>
                        Mr. M.S. Oberoi completed his primary education in Rawalpindi and moved to Lahore for his Bachelor's degree. 
                        Shortly thereafter, to flee the ravages of a virulent plague, he went to seek his fortune in Shimla, the summer 
                        capital of British India. Arriving penniless, he found a job at a monthly salary of INR 50, as the front desk 
                        clerk at the Cecil Hotel. Today, The Oberoi Group owns the hotel The Oberoi Cecil where the young Mr. Royal 
                        found his m√©tier.
